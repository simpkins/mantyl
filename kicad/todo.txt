- add JTAG header?

- USB shield connections
  connect to ground with parallel capacitor and high value resistor?

- tune trace widths.  Check USB data trace lengths.

- confirm OLED connector layout

- ESP32-S3 hardware design guidelines recommend resistor and capacitor on USB
  data lines.  DevKit doesn't include these, though.

- Could possibly add PPTC fuse on input USB power line?
