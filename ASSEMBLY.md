I printed everything with PLA, on a Prusa MK3S.  Most parts require support,
and I just used detachable PLA support.  On Prusaslicer I did increase the
default support Z distance slightly to make it a bit easier to detach.

  I printed this using the Ultimaker Cura slicer, with tree supports.
  Cura does a much better job generating supports for this model than
  Prusaslicer.
