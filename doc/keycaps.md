# Keycaps

The keyboard layout is designed with DSA keycaps in mind.  The DSA profile uses
the same keycap shape for all keys, rather than having different shapes on
different rows of the keyboard.

Various sites offer DSA keycaps, although they are somewhat less common than
other profiles.

The layout uses almost entirely 1x1 keys.  Finding keysets that include 1x1
keys for Ctrl, Shift, Tab, etc is somewhat difficult, and may require buying
individual keycaps for these keys.

The default layout does use two 1x1.5 keys, one on each thumb.

# Notes on key sets

kprepublic.com offers several DSA key sets that include nearly a full set of
1x1 keys: https://kprepublic.com/collections/dsa-profile

mechanicalkeyboards.com offers some DSA sets from Maxkey that are reasonably
priced, and do include many 1x1 keys:

https://pimpmykeyboard.com also offers a number of DSA key sets.  Unfortunately
these are significantly more expensive, and often do not include 1x1 key
options for ctrl, shift, etc.

https://ymdkey.com/collections/dsa also has some DSA key sets.
The XDA profile key caps from YMDK may also work, although I have not tried
them.  YMDK also sells on Amazon, and has a different list of keycap sets on
Amazon than on their website.
