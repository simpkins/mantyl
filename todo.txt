# CAD

  - Numpad:
    - bottom cover
    - hat switch on front
    - figure out status LEDs
    - OLED display hole
    - controller screw standoffs
    - USB connector / hole


# Controller PCB

  - Re-do LEDs.
    - Each sk6812 uses 1mA even when off
    - Other LED driver alternatives:
      - IS31FL3733 / IS31FL3723
        - I2C
        - 12x16; 1 chip supports one RGBW led per key on each half
        - Various other matrix dimensions:
          IS31FL3741: 39x9
          IS31FL3743: 18x11
          IS31FL3737 / IS31FL3731: 12x12
      - Holtek makes some LED drivers:
        - HT1632: 24x16 or 32x8.  4-pin SMI
        - HT16K33: 16x8.  I2C.
          - also supports keyscan
      - Analog devices:
        - MAX6955: 16x8, I2C
          also supports keyscan but only some pins, only 32 keys
          seems quite expensive
        - MAX6954: 16x8, SPI
      - AS1130: 12x11 (charlieplexed with 12 pins)

    - RGBW LEDs:
      - HL-5050RGBW-S1
        Available cheaply from JLCPCB, but top mount.
        Might work on flex PCB would possibly require double sided build.
        Or perhaps attempt to manually mount sockets on back, and have some
        sort of stand-off around LED

      JLCPCB global sourcing parts:
        - Inolux IN-P32TRRRGB
          Also avilable from Digikey
        - SunLED XZMDKCBDDG45S-9
          Not in stock at JLCPCB, seems like they could order it cheaply.
          RGB rather than RGBW
        - Wurth Electronic 156120M173000
      Digikey / Mouser
        - IN-P32TRRRGB
          Cheaper than other options below.
          IN-S124TCRRGB is a reverse mount 1204 option
        - Osram LTRBRASF
          Available from Mouser, rather than JLCPCB.
          Expensive and would require manual assembly
        - QT Brightek QBLP677R-RGB
          Digikey
          Expensive and would require manual assembly
        - Kingbright AAA3528RBGS/08-09 
          Digikey
          Expensive and would require manual assembly

# Firmware

  - finish USB stack re-implementation
    - improved descriptors
    - remote wake-up
    - suspend handling
  - display UI



------------------------

# Low-pri

- V1 firmware:
  - Improve handling of right half disconnect

Low-pri future firmware:
  - Software-based USB serial download functionality
  - KeymapDB: save & load from flash

- docs:
  - Discuss burning the USB_PHY_SEL eFuse

- Low-pri future improvements:
  - custom flex PCB for left and right half keys
  - touchpad below right thumb?
    Azoteq TPS43-201A
  - headphone in + out jacks with volume potentiometer?
  - JTAG header
